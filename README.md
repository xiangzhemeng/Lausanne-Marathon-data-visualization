### Abstract

The Lausanne Marathon is an annual marathon race held in Lausanne since 1993. This road running takes place in autumn (October) and the 20 km of Lausanne takes place in spring (April). Parallel to the marathon, a half-marathon, a 10 km, a 10 km walking and Nordic walking, and a mini-marathon race of 4 km are organised. The Lausanne Marathon is one of the largest annual sporting events of the Canton de Vaud, and attracts up to 2,500 tourists each year.

Our project aims at visualizing the results of the Lausanne Marathon of the past 16 years ranging from 2002 to 2017. In particular, we would like to make hidden patterns apparent, such as distributional differences regarding age groups, genders or experienced compared to inexperienced runners. The data also provides some interesting possibilities for map creation, since the hometown of runners, and in some cases, the nationality of the runners, are available to us.

Our visualization could be useful for past and prospective runners to get a overview of where they stand with their performance, for DataSport who collects time measurements at swiss sport events to help enhance their data presentation, and even for event sponsors who would like to know more about the runners who participate in this event.
